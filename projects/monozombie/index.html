            <h2>Game Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Monozombie is a free-roam tower defense game where the enemies don't follow a set path, but rather rush towards you as fast as they can. As rounds increase, zombies get increased health and speed along with more of them spawning. Luckily, when you kill
                zombies, they give you money that you can spend in the shop to buy various towers. There are three different types of towers: Cannon, Archer, and Buff, each with their own stats and powers. The goal of the game is to survive as many rounds
                as possible!

                This game was created for Game Development and Algorithmic Problem Solving II at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I created it along with my groupmates Ken Adichi-Bartholomay, Eric Fotang, Yevhenii Shyshko Konstantinovich, and Matthew Sorrentino.
                We use Monogame for the base game loop, but every other mechanic had to be made from scratch. We wanted to make a game similar to Dungeon Defenders, where you need to protect some object in the world from enemies using towers. It's is
                a simple concept and had a good scale, which enabled us to finish it in time for our class deadlines.

                Another part of this project was the custom map editor we created using Windows Forms to easily change our world if we wanted to. The editor allows the user to change the map size or place various wall and ground tiles. It then exports the layout into
                a file that can be read by the game when it starts up. The code I wrote in the game automatically updates the sprites used for each tile by incorperating a bitmask. The editor might not look the best visually, but the overall use of it
                was very beneficial to the project.

            <p>
                This game was very difficult to develop because of how little Monogame aids you with the development process. Going into the project, I was used to Unity and the development process using that game engine, so switching to Monogame was a little frustrating
                at times. Overall, however, I did enjoy making the game from scratch and really understanding all of the code we wrote. I have mixed feelings about this game because it doesn't play or look the best, but I think it works as a class project
                game. I like to polish my projects as much as possible to make them presentable, but I just wasn't able to get to a visually appealing point with Monozombie. Since it was a class project, I have no plans of developing the game further
                either.
