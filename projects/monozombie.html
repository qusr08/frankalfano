            <h2>Game Summary</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Monozombie</strong> is a free-roam tower defense game where the enemies don't follow a set path, but rather rush toward you as fast as they can. As the round number increases, zombies gain more health and speed along with more
                of them spawning. Luckily, when you kill zombies, you receive money that you can spend in the shop to buy various towers. There are three different types of towers: Cannon, Archer, and Buff, each with its own stats and powers. The goal
                of the game is to survive as many rounds as possible!
            </p>

                This game was created for Game Development and Algorithmic Problem Solving II at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I created it along with my group mates Ken Adichi-Bartholomay, Eric Fotang, Yevhenii Shyshko Konstantinovich, and Matthew Sorrentino.
                We use Monogame for the base game loop, but every other mechanic had to be made from scratch. We wanted to make a game similar to Dungeon Defenders, where you need to protect some object in the world from enemies using towers. It is a
                simple concept that allowed for a manageable development process, which enabled us to finish it in time for our class deadlines.

                Another part of this project was the custom map editor we created using Windows Forms to easily change our world if we wanted to. The editor allows the user to change the map size or place various wall and ground tiles. It then exports the layout into
                a file that can be read by the game when it starts up. The code I wrote in the game automatically updates the sprites used for each tile by incorporating a bitmask. The editor may not look the best visually, but the overall use of it was
                very beneficial to the project.

            <h2>Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                This game was very difficult to develop because of how little Monogame aids you with the development process. Going into the project, I was used to Unity and the development process using that game engine, so switching to Monogame was slightly frustrating
                at times. Overall, however, I did enjoy making the game from scratch and really understanding all of the code we wrote. I have mixed feelings about this game because it is not as polished as I would have liked, but I think it works as
                a class project game. I like to polish my projects as much as possible to make them presentable, but I simply wasn't able to get to a visually appealing point with <strong>Monozombie</strong>. This project never became
                one that I was quite passionate about, and now that there is no obligation to continue it, I will not be furthering its development.
