            <h2>Game Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Into Orbit is a gravity puzzle game where you launch a spaceship around planets. It is similar to something like Angry Birds, but instead of simple parabolas the birds take there are more complex gravitational fields that pull the ship along. You have
                no control over the ship once it has been launched, you need to make sure it was launched at the correct angle and speed to properly avoid all of the planets. There are various obstacles that can get in your way as well, like walls between
                planets, gates that need to be opened, and asteroids. The goal of the game is to reach the wormhole without crashing.
            </p>
            <p>
                This game was created off of a random idea I was messing around with in Unity. I just made a gravity simulation where objects can be launched at a certain angle and power and get pulled around by the gravity of planets. I showed this idea to Joseph Ferrugio
                and we brainstormed ideas to turn it into a game. Joseph Ferrugio and I even had plans to make a story that went along with the game. The story was going to be about a war prisoner stealing a spacecraft from the opposing side of the war,
                escaping with intelligence that could aid his side of the war. Throughout the game the player would be running away from enemy ships and would have to make various decisions as they try and make it back to their home planet. Overall, I
                think the ideas we came up with are interesting, we just never added them in.

            <h2>Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                I had fun creating this project, but I do not look back on it as one of my best game ideas. The idea is pretty simple, and the puzzle mechanics in their current state are not that interesting. I also don't really like how the player has no control over
                the ship after it has launched because the gameplay boils down to just finding the proper launch angle and speed. I feel like this game could be interesting with more interesting gameplay mechanics, but as of now it can get boring fairly
                quickly. I do not have any plans to take this game any further as I feel like I have moved on from the idea. There are a lot of aspects that I could improve about it, but I do have motivation towards this idea to make it better.
