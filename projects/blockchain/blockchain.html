            <p>
                Blockchain is a puzzle game that revolves around chaining various blocks together. Each block has different properties that allows them to be able to stick to some other blocks or slide past them. You must create different shapes in order to avoid falling
                into the abyss below. Navigate your way to the white button in each level to win!

                This game was created for the 2021 Game Maker's Toolkit 48 Hour Game Jam. The theme for the jam was "Joined Together", and so me and my partner for this project Joeseph Ferrugio decided to take the theme literally and make a game about joining things
                together. The idea was simple and intuitive for players to figure out quickly, which is always very good for game jam games where people play them for a couple minutes on average. We created all of the assets used in the game between ourselves,
                all within 48 hours. Since this was the first game jam either of us had attempted, we were shooting for the top 50% of submissions. We ended up placing in the top 10% out of over 6000 submissions, with our game also being top 2% in the
                "fun" category.

                I am very proud of the final product of this game and am very glad I partook in the jam. I find grid-based puzzle games like Blockchain to be very fun to make and develop mechanics for. Joeseph Ferrugio and I had a lot of other ideas for mechanics to
                implement that would make the gameplay more interesting, but we ran out of time within the 48 hours to actually figure out how to create them.
