            <h2>Game Summary</h2>
            <p>
                In Prichi, you are playing a roguelike game of chess against the computer. You only control one white queen against a randomly generated army of opposing black pieces. Each black piece moves every 4 turns, indicated by a counter next to it. Some of these
                pieces also have special abilities that allow them to alter the game board or make them harder to capture. The goal of the game is to capture all of the black pieces on each board, and survive as many boards as possible. You only get one
                life, so you need to make sure your moves are calculated and thought out.
            </p>
            <p>
                This game was created for the class Introduction to Web Technology for Game Developers at the Rochester Institute of Technology. The prompt for this project was simply "make a game using Javascript" which is simple and allows for a lot of creative freedom.
                I find that my projects turn out a lot better when prompts are open-ended and allow me to do whatever I want to make. I created this project entirely on my own for the class, and receieved playtesting or critiques from my teachers/classmates/friends
                as I was developing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The random generation of the game boards in Prichi took a long time to get to the point it is now. I programmed the generation in a series of steps to not only make it easy to understand when reading the code, but also so it is easy to explain. The steps
                and explanations are listed below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Step 1: Create general shape of the map</strong> - A walker randomly picks a direction to travel to each iteration of a loop, for a certain number of times. The number of times depends on how many rounds the player has survived,
                    so the difficulty ramps up the longer the player survives. This generates a random path on the screen that will be used for the general shape of the map. If the walker navigates itself into a dead end with nowhere to go, then the loop
                    is broken no matter if the correct number of iterations has been reached. This adds a lot of variation to the board shapes.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2: Smooth the shape of the map</strong> - For each position that the walker reached, place tiles in all 8 directions around that position (top-left, top, top-right, etc.). This will remove a lot of holes in the map and make
                    it easier for pieces to navigate around the game board.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3: Place opposing black pieces</strong> - The amount of black pieces placed on the game board depends on the round number (so the difficulty of the game increases the longer you survive) and the size of the randomly generated
                    board. For each piece, a random position is chosen on the board that is not currently occupied. Then a random number is generated between 1 and 4 for the number of turns left until it moves. This offsets the black pieces at the start
                    of the game so they all don't move at once, staggering them to make the gameplay more interesting. If the player is playing "insane" mode, then a random ability has a chance to be put on the piece as well. This chance is also dependant
                    on the number of rounds the player has currently survived.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4: Place white pieces</strong> - Currently, the player only controls one white piece, but the original idea of the game was that the player would control a bunch of white pieces. Through playtesting I realized that having
                    one piece makes the game more fun and challenging, so I stuck with that. This step still has to randomly place a white piece, similar to how black pieces are placed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                I love how this game turned out and how it plays. I want to keep the gameplay of the game as simple as possible but still make it require some strategy and thought. It might not be the most exciting gameplay because the black pieces move at random, but
                I think the overall concept is really interesting. My favorite genre of games are puzzle games, and a very close second is roguelike. This game has aspects from both a roguelike and a puzzle game, and I believe with a lot more mechanics
                added to the gameplay this game could become something really special. However, I am unsure if I want to continue making the game. If I do end up continuing it, I want to remake it in Unity instead of Javascript because I feel that I will
                be able to achieve more that way.
