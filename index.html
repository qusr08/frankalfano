                    <strong>Breakthrough</strong> is an upcoming game that I will be developing with Gabriela Colón-Meléndez. The premise of the game is to take the gameplay from
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a> and add more to it. The player will control a tetris-like piece at the top of their screen, having to move it horizontally and rotate it in order to match a hole that comes
                    up from the bottom of the screen. This concept is also similar to something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_the_Wall_(American_game_show)">Hole In The Wall</a>, where you need to match the hole in order to keep
                    playing.

                <p>
                    <strong>Shifty Dungeon</strong> is a board game I created for a class at the Rochester Insititue of Technology. The premise of the game is to try and find a way to mimic the random generation of roguelike games as an analog board game.
                    The game board is divided into 10 different pieces that are all placed randomly to create a different dungeon structure each time. Players take control of monsters that they can use to battle other players, or battle the dungeon boss
                    and take his crown. The player who escapes with the dungeon boss's crown wins!

                <h4><em>Planning idea</em></h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Cubi</strong> is a 3D puzzle game that takes the same mechanics as in my game <strong>Blockchain</strong> and makes them more complex. The player will be able to shift the camera from an orthographic view (like <strong>Blockchain</strong>)
                    to a perspective view to discover new perspectives of the puzzle. Of course, there will be more complexity in the mechanics, with different worlds that have different themes. For example, I want there to be a lava world that has blocks
                    that burn away, so you only have a certain amount of turns to utilize them.
